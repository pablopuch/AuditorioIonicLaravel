## Usability
### Design 
The main objective when designing the app was trying to making accesible for all publics, (because musicians maybe could have between 6 to 50 years old), but 
also wanted to make it elegant in some way.

We can appreciate that the design is colorful, but without saturation; the information is displayed in a pretty-clear way.

### Readability
Everything in the app is quite simple to read and to understand, displayed in a way throught cards and tabs that is very clear for the user withouth having to
explain it. This gives the main goal that we wanted to achieve with the design: accesibility no matter who is using the app.

We also can appreciate that every section has the same "apperance rules" which gives consistent through all the app.

### Menu navigation
Something to highlight is that we decided to don't put the typical icon of collapsable navbar, because this way was more elegant. Instead, we simply make the bar big enough and the home without many things so it could be intuitive that you just have to tap on it to navigate.

### Interaction
Something that we said already but that we can highlight is that everything is intuitive, including the interaction witht the app. The way that you go from (for example), the summary of the projects in home, to the informationi of that project is really smooth, thanks to the using of cards, that are already stablished in the public that is something you can click in an app to show more information.

### Icons
All are very clear but also gives that contrast that we searched of making the app more attractive, because they are all really colorful.
